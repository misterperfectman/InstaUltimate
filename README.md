It is created to remotely change actions within the shortcut without needing to update the shortcut every time.
It contains the necessary data on dictionaries and texts that are used in the shortcut.

Feel free to check the repository for any useful any information.

### InstaUltimate - *A different Instagram downloader*
With the InstaUltimate shortcut you can view and download profile pictures, stories, and posts from all Instagram profiles (including private accounts) in different ways.


**!!** A faster/lighter version of this shortcut is also available [[**InstaUltimate Lite**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3710)]. It can only run from within the Instagram app and ***does not*** have additional features such as a favorites list or a recents menu. **!!**

#### Features
Aside from the standard things such as getting profile pictures, posts, and stories by copy pasting an Instagram URL, manually inputting a username, or selecting a username from your favorites list, the shortcut also has features such as:

- Download profile pictures (also from private accounts you follow), stories and Instagram posts directly from within the Instagram app itself!
- Download media and stories from private accounts you follow.
- A “recents” menu from which you can easily access your recent searches and make new searches, and even delete them if necessary.
- Get a notification whenever a new update of the shortcut is available. Thanks to [@pfg](https://routinehub.co/user/pfg)'s [Embed-a-Update](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672) shortcut.

#### How to use?
###### Directly from within the Instagram app
To download download a profile picture (also from private accounts), story or full Instagram post of a specific user within the Instagram app, just click on a random post of a specific Instagram user within the Instagram app and press the three dots “(•••)” in the upper right hand corner of the post, after that press “Share with” and run the InstaUltimate shortcut.

###### Media from private accounts you follow
Within Instagram, press the three dots “(•••)” in the upper right hand corner of the post you would like to download, then open Safari and go to the URL you copied (make sure that you are logged in to Instagram within Safari). After that, simply press the share button next to the book symbol and run the InstaUltimate shortcut.

###### Stories from private accounts you follow
To download a story from a private Instagram account you follow, open up Safari (make sure that you are logged in to Instagram within Safari) and view the story you would like to download. Then, simply press the share button next to the book symbol and run the InstaUltimate shortcut. 

**!! The InstaUltimate shortcut might crash sometimes when downloading stories, so I recommend trying my** *[InstaUltimate Lite](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3710) shortcut* **for doing this !!**

Be sure to check out my other shortcut "[**InstaProfile Monitor**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3602)" which monitors for changes to Instagram profile pictures!
